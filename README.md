### Hi there 👋

 I'm Pradip from beautiful city of Pokhara in Nepal. I'm currently studying software engineering and have a passion for creating innovative software solutions. I love learning and expanding my skills through open source projects and hands-on experience.
I tackle technical challenges with determination and a positive attitude. I take pride in delivering quality software and am always up for a new challenge.

In my free time, I enjoy spending time in nature and with my friends. I also like to travel, watch movies, listen to music, and write. I have a special interest in music, art, and new inventions, and my goal is to learn to play the guitar someday.

I believe in constantly growing and learning, both professionally and personally I'm grateful for the chance to introduce myself and look forward to future opportunities.
